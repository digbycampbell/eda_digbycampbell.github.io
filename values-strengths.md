**Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.**



**Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.**

My family has instilled quite a good work ethic in me, which I am grateful for. Also honesty and ability to trust others, which is also cultural aspect we are fortunate to have in New Zealand.

Flipping this question on its head - the most I learned about values was by leaving NZ and experiencing other cultures, which taught me the importance of self reliance, personal responsibility and individual liberty. Here in NZ we have so many opportunities that others are not privileged to have, but still choose to blame others and act too lazy or complacent take advantage and execute on these opportunities. Naturally, I include myself in this statement and always try to be conscious of these learnings.

**Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.**

I used quiz tools. Looking at the commonalities between the results my identified strengths were:  
'Judgement' - looking at issues and problems critically and objectively from both sides to help identify solutions
'Assertiveness' - being decisive in taking action
'Curiosity' - interested in learning and knowledge for its own sake

I think it is quite self-evident that these qualities will help me learn software development at devacademy!

**Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?**

So far, my career has been in a single industry. I have learned how to navigate the culture of this industry and learned about the expectations. I think it will be quite different in a different industry, because the demographics, commercial arrangements, relationships and incentives are all very different in a new industry.

I am familiar with the student environment and so I expect devacademy to be a great learning environment, but if I'm working in tech I am sure there will be lots of new ways of working and ways to learn.

**Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.**

A situation arose at a project I worked at where a team member was not willing to do any work outside of a narrow scope of their role description. This was made more complicated because this was and inter-organisational project so team members were employed by separate companies, and their manager was off-site. There were cultural differences involved too as the project was in Europe.

The other members of the team were very flexible and 'can-do' attitude, and so we tried to convice this member to contribute more widely, but without success.

Looking at the situation with hindsight, firstly I think the team as a whole was reasonable and accommodating and understanding of the individual. To improve the outcome we might have made more effort to compromise on the requests for extra effort because, with hindsight, it is possible to recognise that probably the individual did not feel competent and was uncomfortable with the extra expectation.
