      <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
      <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and rewire itself throughout life. Knowledge of this
         principle is powerful - individuals can recognize that they have the power to literally shape their own brain
         and, in turn, improve their cognitive abilities, emotional well-being, and overall performance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
      <p>
         Something which came up in the material was the relationship between our thinking brain and movement. My
         experience thus far in my career has taught me that when I am more active and move during my working day, I
         am more satisfied and fulfilled in my work, and happier overall.
         <br>
         I have been wrestling with this understanding and the expectation that a software/tech role will inevitably be
         desk and office bound. Learning about neuroplasticity has provided solid reasoning to my suspicions, and
         encourages me to focus more on the connection between movement, exercise and brain health and intellectual
         performance.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>As mentioned above, I found an interesting video (below) which provides an argument and evidence that our
         brains are most neuroplastic when we are moving. A large majority of the brain is dedicated to motor movement
         (especially our hands) which indicates the importance of movement of our bodies to our biology, especially when
         our way of life has changed to be more sedentary and static than before.</p>

      <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>A growth mindset is the belief that ones abilities and intelligence are not fixed, and can be developed through
         their life with practice and hard work. This mindset is shown to
         foster a positive attitude towards learning and growth. This is especially relevant to understand as an adult
         student, learning new skills outside of traditional schooling.
         There is evidence that individuals with a growth mindset are more resilient, more open to new challenges, and
         more successful and in their lives.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
         One of the most interesting insights I heard when I was learning about growth mindset was about the importance
         of intention and focus for our learning. Research shows that it is not enough to 'be present' in a learning
         environment, we have to consciously <strong>decide</strong> what we want to learn and consciously begin/engage
         in the action of learning.
         Further to this, the learning process itself is vastly improved when the the learning process is well focussed.
         This sounds obvious, but the argument or insight is that reducing even small distractions can vastly
         improve the learning process (understanding & retention) - even if you don't notice much difference
         superficially, the difference is material.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
         The above findings almost seem obvious, but are powerful reminders of the recommendations devacademy makes when
         beginning bootcamp. Reducing distractions needs to be a priority for me - as I have family and work colleagues
         who are still not conscious of my change of situation.
