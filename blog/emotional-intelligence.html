      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Think of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) as your emotional GPS. Just like a GPS helps you navigate through the roads, EQ helps you navigate through life by understanding and managing
          your own emotions and the emotions of others. It's all about recognizing
          and regulating your feelings, being empathetic, and communicating
          effectively. With a strong EQ, you can build stronger relationships,
          handle life's stressors like a boss, and make smart decisions. <h3>EQ vs IQ</h3> <p>
          IQ is like a measuring tape for your brain. It tests your cognitive
          ability, including how well you can think, solve problems, and learn new
          things. But just like a measuring tape only tells you the length, IQ
          only measures a tiny part of who you are. </p><p>          EQ, on the other hand, is like
          a personal trainer for your emotions. It helps you get in shape and
          perform better in life. Research has shown that EQ is a stronger
          predictor of success in life and at work than IQ. That's because having
          a strong EQ helps you navigate social situations, build solid
          relationships, and handle life's ups and downs with ease. </p>
          <h3>Why is EQ Important?</h3>
          <p>Imagine trying to drive a car without a GPS. It's
        frustrating, confusing, and you might end up lost. The same goes for
        life without emotional intelligence. Without EQ, you can't understand
        and manage your emotions and those of others, which can lead to bad
        decisions, ruined relationships, and a lot of stress. But with a strong
        EQ, you're equipped with the tools you need to navigate life's ups and
        downs and thrive in both your personal and professional life.</p>
