      <h5>Reflecting on Foundations:</h5>
      <br>
      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
      <p>1. The impact of the learning environment and the distractions around me, and tools I can use to create an
         optimal learning environment for myself.<br>
         2. The importance of adopting the 'growth mindset' and embracing challenges as a method to learn more
         effectively.
         <br>
         3. The role of values in my motivation, and how aligning my career choices with my values means a more
         fulfilling experience.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h3>
      <p>Understanding my values will help me make more informed decisions about my career path, and
         ensure that I am working on projects that align with my goals and values. Empathy and self-awareness
         are important tools to work effectively with others. They help to understand others' perspectives and
         motivations, which is a good starting point for aligning incentives and setting common goals to work out as a
         group.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>I really enjoyed the learnings about neuroplasticity - and the extensive amount of material available to
         research this subject. Its a really important topic to internalise
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
         Writing the blogs to succintly sum up the learnings is quite difficult. Even if you think you learned something
         valuable getting it out into words which form a sensible narrative and convey information & understanding is
         another thing altogether.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
         development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
         As the tutors have said, this has been the feedback from students and employers about what skills make better
         employees.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
         time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
         I don't think that this time could be better spent practising programming, because we already have quite a full
         schedule of learning and feels like there is a limit to how much you can do. I think the 'research' sections of
         the core learning was good and valuable, but I felt like the 'asssement' parts (writing blogs etc.) was
         tedious.
