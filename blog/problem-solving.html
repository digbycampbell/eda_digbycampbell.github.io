      <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
      <h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      <p>
         Sometimes, even when doing something I'm familiar with, I might run into issues. When I was trying some of the
         'javascript-kata' exercises (devacademy homework) I couldn't solve an exercise which involved performing some
         code steps on some words. Despite multiple attempts, I was
         unable to produce the desired output. My first problem solving step usually involves
         <strong>console.log</strong>ing my code, which lets me monitor the outcome of each line of code.
         If the code seems to be running ok, but just not giving me what I want, its time to try something new. Usually
         I'll temporarily remove pieces of my code and experimenting with new and different approaches or techniques.
         If that doesn't work and I'm really frsutrated, the Rubber ducky method can help, but usually I will turn to
         google at that point.
         In this particular instance, I couldn't quite work my google magic - and I called it quits for the day. When I
         came back the next morning, I was able to easily solve the problem - which just goes to show that taking a
         break is a problem solving technique in itself!
      </p>
      <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      <p>
         Elegantly solving a problem usually happens the second time around for me. Generally, when first encountering a
         problem the most important thing is getting the right output. Using the techniques described above, and others
         (like using pseudocode) to get your code to do <strong>what</strong> you want it to do is the first priority.
         After that, often when I've moved on to the next stages of code (perhaps the stage where I will use the
         previous code) it becomes obvious that there is a more elegant method of delivering the same result. I think
         this demonstrates that code is an iterative process, even if you get it to do what you want, you can always
         improve <strong>how</strong> it does it.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
      <p>
         In terms of problem-solving techniques, I feel confident trying new techniques to solve problems, writing
         pseudocode, asking google, chatGPT, and the coaches for help. I am also conscious to always read
         error messages and create your own logs with console.log.

         These blogs, our facilitators and the other course material helps me reflect on the problem solving process,
         and offers suggestions and improve and develop our problem solving habits.
