      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
         I would like to be able to find a role which can take advantage of my
         skills in the electrical sector (electrical grid, electrical systems,
         control systems) but also makes use of new skills in software
         development. I can see that there is a huge gap between modern tools &
         technologies and those which are being used in the electrical sector.
      </p>
      <h3>
         A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
         learning
      </h3>
      <p>
         I am a fast learner and usually don't have issues picking up concepts.
         Sometimes I find it hard to keep on task when I feel like I am ahead and
         get complacent. <br />I have a good memory and find it tedious to carry
         out repetitive practice exercises when I have already grapsed the
         concept - I prefer to put it into practice and I think the devaademy
         system encourages this style of learning.
      </p>
      <h3>
         What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
         developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
         Time management skills. I have already appreciated the suggested use of
         toggl. I required stronger time management skills at university than in
         industry and I think devacademy will be a similar experience.
      </p>
      <h3>
         A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:
      </h3>
      <p>
         I expect to have minimal distractions, as I have the support of my
         girlfriend. I have also made my needs clear to my work and I am taking
         an extended absence. I am not afraid to reach out to the facilitators
         when I need support.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
         From what I have seen from the team so far it is quite a hands off
         approach. I expect that will be slightly different when lectures etc.
         begin during bootcamp - and I hope that the facilitators are continually
         assessing progress to make sure we're coping and not falling behind.
      </p>
      <h3>
         Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
         committed to other things:
      </h3>
      <p>
         I have asked my work not to give me any new projects, however some weeks
         of Foundations I might be asked to give some input for some of my
         existing/old project, usually just in the form of meetings or calls of a
         low time committment.
