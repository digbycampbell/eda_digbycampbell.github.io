      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to be able to find a role which can take advantage of my
        skills in the electrical sector (electrical grid, electrical systems,
        control systems) but also makes use of new skills in software
        development. I can see that there is a huge gap between modern tools &
        technologies and those which are being used in the electrical sector.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a fast learner and usually pick up concepts on the first try.
        Sometimes I find it hard to keep on task when I feel like I am ahead and
        get complacent. <br />I have a strong memory and find it tedious to
        carry out repetitive practice exercises when I have already grapsed the
        concept - I prefer to put it into practice and I think the devaademy
        system.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Time management skills. I have already appreciated the suggested use of
        toggl. I required stronger time management skills at university than in
        industry and I think devacademy will be a similar experience.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I expect to have minimal distractions, as I have the support of my
        girlfriend. I have also made my needs clear to my work and I am taking
        an extended absence. I am not afraid to reach out to the facilitators
        when I need support.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        From what I have seen from the team so far it is quite a hands off
        approach. I expect that will be slightly different when lectures etc.
        begin during bootcamp - and I hope that the facilitators are continually
        assessing progress to make sure we're coping and not falling behind.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have asked my work not to give me any new projects, however some weeks
        of Foundations I might be asked to give some input for some of my
        existing/old project, usually just in the form of meetings or calls of a
        low time committment.
