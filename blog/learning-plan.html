      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
         My original intention is still relevant here: I would like to be able to find a role which can take
         advantage of my
         skills in the electrical sector (electrical grid, electrical systems,
         control systems) but also makes use of new skills and tools used in software
         development. Especially when it relates to software tools - there is a big gap
         between the latest available technologies and those which are being used in the electrical sector.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
         What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
         Reflecting on foundations, I think my strengths and weaknesses was in the right ballpark. My mind can wander
         when trying to stay focussed for long periods of time, and I work better in shorter bursts. For bootcamp, I
         expect this will be the challenge to stay focussed and on task.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>
         As mentioned above - keeping on top of all the work instead of just focussing on the parts I enjoy or grab my
         attention, and keeping focussed for the full nine weeks.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
         What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
         developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
         I think time management skills, as mentioned previously, will be a good to improve on (my industry is not very
         punctual) - but I also think that my experience with pair programming in foundations makes me want to work on
         that more. Its very difficult to know the correct way to watch over someones shoulder while they code but I
         think its also very beneficial (for both parties).
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>I really like the 'contact' time with tutors - seminars and code-alongs are great ways to learn and I think
         these will be the most valuable parts of bootcamp. Other than that, more of the same as we got from the
         foundations team - who were very good when we come to ask for help.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
         I think I have struck an ok balance of asking for help with the tutors - but in bootcamp I expect the material
         will be coming faster and more crammed - so it makes it even more important to ask for help early to make the
         most of our time. I've had only positive experiences with other classmates so far so hoping to be able to
         continue that with other devacademy students.

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
         I would like to be able to find a role which can take advantage of my
         skills in the electrical sector (electrical grid, electrical systems,
         control systems) but also makes use of new skills in software
         development. I can see that there is a huge gap between modern tools &
         technologies and those which are being used in the electrical sector.

      <h3>
         A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
         learning
      </h3>
      <p>
         I am a fast learner and usually don't have issues picking up concepts.
         Sometimes I find it hard to keep on task when I feel like I am ahead and
         get complacent. <br />I have a good memory and find it tedious to carry
         out repetitive practice exercises when I have already grapsed the
         concept - I prefer to put it into practice and I think the devaademy
         system encourages this style of learning.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
         What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
         developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
         Time management skills. I have already appreciated the suggested use of
         toggl. I required stronger time management skills at university than in
         industry and I think devacademy will be a similar experience.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
         A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:
      </h3>
      <p>
         I expect to have minimal distractions, as I have the support of my
         girlfriend. I have also made my needs clear to my work and I am taking
         an extended absence. I am not afraid to reach out to the facilitators
         when I need support.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
         From what I have seen from the team so far it is quite a hands off
         approach. I expect that will be slightly different when lectures etc.
         begin during bootcamp - and I hope that the facilitators are continually
         assessing progress to make sure we're coping and not falling behind.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
         Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
         committed to other things:
      </h3>
      <p>
         I have asked my work not to give me any new projects, however some weeks
         of Foundations I might be asked to give some input for some of my
         existing/old project, usually just in the form of meetings or calls of a
         low time committment.
