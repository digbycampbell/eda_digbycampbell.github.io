      <h3>
         An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
      </h3>
      <p>
         Building a website is a bit like making a movie. HTML is story and the
         script, and lays out the content in a sensible fashion. CSS is like the
         set design and costumes, makes the movie look interesting and pleasing
         to the eye. Finally, Javascript is the special effects, camerawork and
         editing. Its what turns a linear representation of the acting and
         storyline into something dynamic and exciting - making the movie
         immersive and memorable.

      <h3>
         Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
         life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
      </h3>
      <p>
         Control flow is a technique used in programming to make different
         choices depending on the conditions. For example, if you check the
         weather for the day, you will take a different action (wear a jacket,
         drive your car instead of walking) depending on the conditions. Loops
         are used to perform the same action multiple times with new conditions.
         Like a teacher doing parent-teacher interviews, they will sit down and
         perform a similar routine for each new set of parents who arrives at
         their desk, with different results.
      </p>
      <h3>
         Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
         it?
      </h3>
      <p>
         The DOM is a bit like the contents of a large instruction manual or
         textbook. Every thing (element) on a website is indexed and the DOM is
         how you can find it and point to each element or its content.
      </p>
      <h3>
         Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </h3>
      <p>
         Arrays and objects are like different music storage. An array is like a
         mix tape or DJ set, playing one song after the next. An object is like a
         music database (iTunes, Spotify) which keeps meta data and lets you pick
         out a song according to title, artist, album etc.
      </p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
      <p>
         A functions is an instruction set. In the front of a beginners cookbook
         there will be instruction sets on, for example, how to chop - dice,
         slice, julienne - which will be reused throughout the book. Functions
         are helpful because they allow you to reuse code. Instead of writing the
         same code multiple times, you can write it once in a function and call
         that function whenever you need it. This makes your code more organized
         and easier to maintain.
